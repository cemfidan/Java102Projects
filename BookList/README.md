## BookList

The Book class consists of the name of the book, the number of pages, the name of the author, and the date of publication.

It produced 10 objects from the Book class and stored them in an ArrayList structure. It was written to create a new Map<String, String> with the name of the author opposite the name of the book, using the stream structure and lambda expressions.



An enhancement has been made to filter the books with more than 100 pages from this 10-item Book list and return them as a new list.
